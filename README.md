To escape you must reverse time and collobarate with your past self to push buttons, make daring leaps, and occasionally sacrifice your past self.

**Caveats**
Safari doesn't support pointer lock and the physics are a little screwy on Fire Fox. It is recommended that this game be played on Chrome or Opera.
